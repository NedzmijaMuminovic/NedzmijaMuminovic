## Hi there! 👋

🎓 I'm a fourth-year Software Engineering student at the Faculty of Information Technologies.

💻 Currently, I'm diving into the world of Go and React.

🚀 While I may not have loads of experience just yet, I'm open to internships and job opportunities to gain more hands-on knowledge and skills.

😊 Let's connect and learn together! Feel free to explore my projects and drop me a message.
