## Hi there! 👋

🎓 My name is Nedžmija Muminović and I'm a fourth-year Software Engineering student at the Faculty of Information Technologies.

💻 I have the most experience in .NET and Angular, and I learned Go and React at my previous internship.

📱 I am currently learning Flutter and developing a mobile and desktop cinema app using .NET and Flutter.

💼 I'm open to internships and job opportunities to gain more hands-on knowledge and skills. While open to full-stack roles, my passion lies in frontend development.

😊 Let's connect and learn together! Feel free to explore my projects and drop me a message.
